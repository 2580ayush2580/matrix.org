That's right folks Synapse 1.5.0 is here and ready to make your life just a little bit better.

The main thing you'll notice in 1.5.0 is a massive performance improvement to the room directory, which means that servers with large directories to scan will return much more quickly. This is especially true for matrix.org but all servers will benefit.

Another key win is finally fixing some bugs in the sqlite -> postgres migrator script. Sqlite mode is there strictly for testing purposes and should never be used in a production setting let alone a federating homeserver. So if you are currently using sqlite now is the time to upgrade. What's more the script is now in CI so it can't easily break in the future (with apologies to anyone bitten by the old script).

Aside from that we have the usual host of bug fixes and performance improvements, also worth noting that we've tightened up some of the event signature checking code.

A final final point, we have some preparatory work for e2ee cross signing, the overall feature is not ready for release just yet but we are getting really close. Watch this space.

As ever, you can get the new update [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.5.0) or any of the sources mentioned at [https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse).
